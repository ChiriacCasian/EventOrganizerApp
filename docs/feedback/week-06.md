# Meeting Week 6

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass.

Feedback: Both minute-taker and chairperson were present.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent.

Feedback: You guys are doing very well with the agendas. This week's agenda was again detailed and nicely formatted. No remarks.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient.

Feedback: Notes were not very detailed and have some punctuation/spacing problems resulting in sentences like: "Picture of the board on Whatsapp Scenes and controllers Integrate the API to the controllers Create Yamal file, for the endpoints?". This is probably due to the visualization in Markdown but still try to pay attention to the readability of the document.



#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient. 

Feedback: You were introducing the discussion points but not guiding the flow of the conversation. It felt like a very free discussion, which is not necessarily bad but it does deviate from the structured format of the meeting that is expected. At one point, people were talking between each other and not participating in a group discussion. As a chair, you should aim to make the meeting as focused and concise as possible. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good.

Feedback: Friendly environment. Most people were actively contributing. Conversation was constructive and individual team members were listening to each other.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient.

Feedback: No shippable product yet but you guys are making progress. Well-organized backend. You seem to be on track? Although, it is hard for me to tell because I couldn't see what part of the features are already working (due to the Runtime Exception in the client).

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient.

Feedback: No task division was made during the meeting but I can see that you guys have assigned issues in GitLab, so I assume you already have the task division for the following week.
