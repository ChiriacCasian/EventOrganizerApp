# Week 1 Feedback

### 1) Self-organization

####  Good.
 Some people didn't participate as much in the discussions. Aim so that everyone contributes equally and expresses their thoughts, as this is an integral part of the learning objectives and the working process. To do so, you can ask a teammate to share their opinion, if you see that they are not being very active. It is nice that you already established how you will communicate from now on and distributed the chairperson/minute-taker roles.

### 2) Suggested Topics

#### Sufficient. 
As a general advice, aim to come prepared to meetings so you can use the time to discuss and make decisions relevant to the project. Try to minimize the time you spend reading (or coding, for example), as this will prevent you from using the allocated meeting time to its full potential. It is nice that you opened the assignments teamwork document to keep track of all suggested topics. This was useful for structuring the meeting. For the following meetings, the meeting structure should be ensured by the agenda handed in by the chair.
