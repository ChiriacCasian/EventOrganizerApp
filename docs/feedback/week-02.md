# Meeting Week 2

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass.

Feedback: Both minute-taker and chairperson were present.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent.

Feedback: Agenda was uploaded on time. Discussion points were clearly listed. Very nice that you also included relevant URL links for the other team members. As a general advice, make sure that agenda is viewed by team members prior to the meeting. Of course, it is not your responsibility if they do so, but do send it to them in advance and ask them to review it and suggest additions (or if they find a discussion point unnecessary to remove it). Generally, you should have all agreed on the agenda before the meeting and make last-minute additions if something has come up after uploading the agenda.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Not applicable.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good. 

Feedback: Overall very good job. You ensured that all agenda topics were covered and asked questions to guide the discussion and introduce the separate topics. However, strive to include all team members in the conversation to ensure everyone agrees on the decision-making process. I noticed that you shared your thoughts and tried to ask others if they agree with you, but you can also ask individual team members about their opinion if you notice they are being silent. Also, keep in mind that as a chairperson, you are supposed to guide the flow of the meeting but don't feel you have to dominate the conversation or provide solutions.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good.

Feedback: You guys led the meeting yourself and were respectful to one another. However, there were some people that contributed less, so try all to participate. Otherwise, very nice and constructive atmosphere.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient.

Feedback: No application has been presented. No code contributions. 
Keep in mind that as of next week you need to already have individual code contributions to the project.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Insufficient.

Feedback: No task division was made. Since, you guys haven't started coding yet, you didn't assign individual work to people.
