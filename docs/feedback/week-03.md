# Meeting Week 3

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass.

Feedback: Both minute-taker and chairperson were present.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent.

Feedback: Agenda was uploaded on time. Very well done - clear and easy to follow, consistent with the template. You provided necessary relevant details for each subpoint, you used bullet points which was also nice. Overall no remarks.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good.

Feedback: Well-structured notes. Nice that you used bullet points. Notes are complete and cover the discussed topics. However, try to avoid generic statements and strive to be more specific. Include intricate details that you may need to remember later. Also, you don't just mention what was discussed. Mention what concrete decisions were made and what arguments were used in case you need to recall not just the outcome but also the reasoning behind a design choice.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient. 

Feedback: You started strong, but at one point I noticed you were barely monitoring, as other people took charge of the meeting introducing topics that were not planned in the agenda. I did like how you were introducing topics and keeping them open-ended to encourage others to participate. However, you should also be careful if someone vastly deviates from the discussed topic. Of course, if you all agree something urgent outside of the agenda needs to be discussed that's perfectly fine. But do make sure you complete the intended organizational work as well.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good.

Feedback: Some people didn't contribute as much. It would be nice to see everyone showing initiative and participating in the discussion. You as a group may try to ask each other questions, when you notice that a team member is not being engaged to ensure you are all on the same page.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient.

Feedback: No application has been presented. Be mindful of the knock-out criteria for individual contributions. Also, pipeline was failing which is something to be careful about. It is okay to have the pipeline fail in feature branches but not on main especially in bigger projects or at a later stage of development.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Insufficient.

Feedback: No task division was made.
