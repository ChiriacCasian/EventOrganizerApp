# Meeting Week 7

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass.

Feedback: Both minute-taker and chairperson were present.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent.

Feedback: Agenda is detailed, follows the template. Uploaded on time. No remarks.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good.

Feedback: A bit generic. For example, "Frank jumped to the next topic". However, overall good: covers the meeting. I loved the "Frank asked the TA if she had any questions."


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good. 

Feedback: You monitored the flow of the meeting. Many people talked, it was a bit chaotic but that I guess was fine because it was just due to people brainstorming. I feel like you covered a lot of topics, although I am not sure if you as a team made decisions how to handle all discussed problems. You guys gave more of an outline of what's wrong, but that is also a good start.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent.

Feedback: Everyone was contributing. Very friendly environment. Attitude was respectful and teammates were listening to each other.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient.

Feedback: No shippable product yet but a good part of the basic application was done.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient.

Feedback: No task division was made during the meeting but I can see that you guys have assigned issues in GitLab, so I assume you already have the task division for the following week.
