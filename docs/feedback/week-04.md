# Meeting Week 4

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass.

Feedback: Both minute-taker and chairperson were present.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent.

Feedback: Uploaded on time. Nice appropriate formatting that follows that suggested template and makes it easy to follow. 

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good.

Feedback: Good use of formatting and good structuring of the notes. However, strive to make them more detailed, as there are some very ambiguous bullet points. For example, "Simeon asked about the 100 lines of code and how we would be able to reach it", what was the answer? Or, "We agreed to aim to be done with the Java FX by thursday", does that refer to reading course material or setting up the project or implementing frontend, etc. Strive to be more specific and clear in your wording.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent. 

Feedback: You followed the agenda template. You had very good time management and monitoring of the discussion. I noticed you asked people individual questions and ensured the meeting does not deviate from the intended talking points. Also, your idea with using the board showed good initiative and helped keep the meeting well-structured. Very well done!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good.

Feedback: Started a bit chaotic but then the conversation flow continued smoothly. It would be nice to hear more from some people. Same advice as last week: if you notice someone remains quiet for a long time you can check with them if they are engaged and agree with what is being said. If you notice, you are talking much more than the rest of your group, maybe slow down, so others can join.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient.

Feedback: No application has been presented. I can tell some work is being done but not what in particular. If you want feedback on this section though, you should show me a demo during the meeting slot.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Some task division was made. Strive to carefully test the MR you are reviewing and try to give meaningful MR reviews to avoid merging incomplete work and propagate bugs.
