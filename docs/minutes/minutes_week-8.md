goal for this week: check on progress and finish and polish already started features
## What is done but needs polishing?
- Language Switch is almost done but needs to be finished 
- fixing a few things related to undo function in Participant
- flickering bug and stacking buttons bug in expenseOverview and EditExpense need to be fixed
## What missing features did the group notice in its work?
- viewing total expenses and share per person need to be done
- a few more keyboard shortcuts
- IBAN and BIC validation
- UI overall look (such as font, bold, possibly colors and ability to resize windows)
- a comprehensive Readme
- currency selection 
- copying invite code from the scene directly
## Decisions
- Work Division :
	- Frank: Centralize all scenes in fullscreen mode + copying inviteCode from scene 
    - Pelayo: make password show up in server console instead of client console + delete password when client is closed
	- Simeon: displaying name (email) in Expense + currency selection in Expense
    - Nico: make a template for frontend testing + finishing up the live language switch 
    - Casian: finish the Participant undo functionality + add email, bic, iban validators for adding a Participant
